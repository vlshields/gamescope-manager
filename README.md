# Gamescope Manager

A psuedo package manager for gamescope on Debian Trixie.

**Background**

Gamescope did not make it into Debian's latest stable release. Gamescope is an amazing tool built by Valve. It is a microcompositor built specifically for
Steam and allows users to create standalone or nested "Steam Sessions". Since Debian Trixie is a great distro for gaming (especially if you want a stable distro like me), I thought this script might be useful for others. Another option would be to pin gamescope from the unstable repository - but that is a bit involved and not really worth it for a single package. Before building gamescope-manager I would manually check for a new version once in a while and use wget to pull in the .deb and install. gamescope-manager automates that process and does even more.

**Caution**

Debian developers offer hours of their free time to ensure *every* package in debian's stable release is very thoroughly tested. If you install gamescope on Trixie and experiance bugs or breakages please *do not* report them to the Debian Bug Tracker. Use this manager at your own risk.
